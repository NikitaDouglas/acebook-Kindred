# Welcome to Kindred

## What is Kindred?

Kindred is a response to the [Makers Acebook Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/acebook-rails-template) - it’s a Facebook clone; you can sign-up, see posts from other users, like posts, and write your own - it was built by [Nikita](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas), [Sophie](https://github.com/sophiewo), [Tim](https://github.com/TimCPB), and [Victor](https://github.com/victorvallet)

The name of our team and of our app is Kindred, a gesture towards the kindness and community feeling we aimed to enshrine in our app and our process -  we’ve written about our approach [here](https://github.com/NikitaDouglas/acebook-Kindred/blob/master/Approach.md).
