# Approach

We approached this challenge by prioritising good teamwork, group-learning, and high-quality processes. 

We began the week by creating a Team Charter to clarify the values we had as a team and ensure that our goals were aligned. We also defined four team roles - Leader, Scribe, Challenger, and Helper - and we rotated them each day to ensure that we all gained experience in each skill set. 

In order to prioritise our learning we used Github’s Wiki feature - when a team member felt that the work they had learnt something they wrote a Wiki to summarise their findings so that we could use the knowledge again inf future projects. This also helped to achieve our goal of learning as a group - one member’s could be shared with all members.

We worked in an Agile way - the project was two-weeks long and we worked in two-day sprints; every day we had a morning stand-up, a lunchtime alignment meeting, and an afternoon/evening retro. 

We used Trello to manage our workload, estimating the length of time a feature would take to create, assigning team members to take ownership of a feature, and breaking those features down into smaller tasks - researching the technologies, test driving the feature, and writing our code,
